# Predicting Exam Scores based on Study Hours

## Overview

This project aims to predict students' final exam scores based on the number of hours they study. Leveraging the power of machine learning, we utilize a simple linear regression model to establish a relationship between study hours and exam performance.

## Key Features

- Utilizes Python programming language.
- Integrates scikit-learn library for machine learning functionalities.
- Implements a simple linear regression model for predictive analysis.
- Provides insights into the correlation between study habits and academic success.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd yourrepositoryname
    ```

4. **Run the Code:**
    ```bash
